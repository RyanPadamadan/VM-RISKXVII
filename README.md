# VM-RISKXVII
Created a virtual machine in C, which takes in RISKVII instructions and can perform operations. The RISKVII is a subset of the official RV32I instruction set. The virtual machine takes a binary file input and processes the different instructions. The VM also has virtul memory, allowing user to allocate virtual memory, that is not part of the stack. Each operation has a different opcode, and immediate value which are extracted from each 32-bit binary instruction. This project was part of the Systems Programming course 2023.
